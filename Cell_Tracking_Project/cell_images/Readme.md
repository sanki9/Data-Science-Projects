# Info about the Folders

The three sequences that were used for this project are as follow:
  1. DIC-C2DH-HeLa
  2. Fluo-N2DL-HeLa
  3. PhC-C2DL-PSC
 
These sequences will need to be downloaded from this [link](http://celltrackingchallenge.net/datasets/) and must be placed inside the cell_images folder.

Each of the three folders contains four image sequences showing many moving and dividing cells.

The files in each folder are the successive time points of the sequence and are named t***.tif accordingly, where *** is the number of the time point.

For some of the cells in some of the time points in some of the sequences, hand-drawn masks are available for training models, if needed.

If you want to use these images for other purposes, you are bound by the Conditions of Use of the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC):
